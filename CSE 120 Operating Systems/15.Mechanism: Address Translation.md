## Mechanism: Address Translation

limited direct execution (LDE):

	1. most part runs on hardware
	1. certain key points OS gets involved (such as when a process issues a system call, or a timer interrupt occurs)



Efficiency and Control

- Efficiency: make use of hardware support
- Control: OS ensures the safety between applications



hardware-based address translation

- performed by the hardware
- changing the **virtual** address provided by the instruction to a **physical** address where the desired information is actually located
