The goal of this class is to expose students to advanced programming language ideas, including high-level programming abstractions, expressive type systems and program analyses. We will develop these ideas as follows.

1. First, we will see how the *lambda calculus* can be used to distill essence of computation into a few powerful constructs, and we will use it as a launching pad to study expressive type systems, logics and analyses that can make precise predictions about run-time behavior at compile time.
2. Second, we will study how this calculus yields [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/), a *functional* programming language that has been the incubator for many recent PL advances. We will use Haskell to learn about a variety of high-level programming abstractions and techniques.
